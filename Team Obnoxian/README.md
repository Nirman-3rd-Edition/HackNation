# Project Overview

## Website Design - Figma

We have done the complete website design in figma and we will try to convert it into code later if time permits. 3D model interaction could not be implemented in the figma file since it was showing error.

## Chatbot Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We have created a chatbot with the name "Cop Bot". We have integrated it currently with the chatgpt api, since a custom api for our model and project will require time and model training. Currently, the cop bot replies to every answer we ask to it, but later we will be adding limits so that questions out of our interest will be denied to be answered.

## React Dashboard - React, TypeScript, HTML, SCSS

This dashboard serves as a tool for police officers engaged in training activities. It provides analytical insights into the performance of officers during training sessions and offers suggestions for enhancing their skills. Additionally, it includes a wishlist and shop feature, which will be integrated in the future. These features aim to facilitate officers in learning about various equipment, their applications, and more. For the current scenario, we have not hosted a website or created an application but we seem to do so in the nearby future.
