#NIRMAN HACKATHON ABSTRACT
<br>
Basic Details of The Team and Problem Statement: Farmers currently face a significant challenge due 
to the lack of access to crucial information and tools that could promote sustainable agricultural practices. 
This deficiency leads to adverse consequences, including environmental degradation and a decrease in 
overall productivity within the agricultural sector. The proposed solution involves the creation of an 
integrated platform designed to address the information gap and equip farmers with essential resources. 
This platform will offer real-time weather updates, agricultural best practices, and market information.

ABSTRACT (Describe your idea/ Solution/Prototype):
Hack Wizards proposes an innovative solution to address the issue of farmers lacking access to information 
and tools promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Our solution, Farm guru, is an integrated platform 
providing real-time weather updates, agricultural best practices, and market information. This empowers 
farmers to adopt sustainable farming methods, stimulating environmental conservation and increasing crop 
yields.
Key Features: -
1. Real-Time Weather Updates: The platform ensures that farmers receive accurate and timely 
weather information for informed decisions for planting and harvesting.
2. Agricultural Best Practices: A database that offers farmers sustainable farming methods tailored 
to different crops and regions, optimizing agricultural practices through tutorials
3. Market Information: Access to market trends, prices, and contact list of buyers of small- and largescale communities
4. Community Collaboration: The platform facilitates communication and knowledge sharing among 
farmers, creating a supportive community for the exchange of ideas and experiences
5. Farm Accessory Rentals: It includes a feature allowing farmers to rent agricultural tools and 
equipment, promoting cost-effectiveness and provides farmers with access to resources they may 
not own, contributing to increased efficiency and reduced financial burden
Benefits: -
• By adopting sustainable practices and leveraging real-time information, farmers can enhance their 
crop yields and overall productivity.
• Access to market information enables farmers to make informed decisions, leading to better 
financial outcomes.
• contributes to the conservation of the environment by promoting practices that reduce soil 
degradation, water pollution, and overall environmental impact.
• The platform fosters a sense of community among farmers, encouraging collaboration and shared 
learning.
• The farm accessory rental feature allows farmers to access tools and equipment without the 
upfront cost, promoting resource efficiency and reducing financial barriers.
Technology Used:
• Front-End Technologies:
o React.js:
▪ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
▪ Components-based architecture for reusable and modular UI development.
▪ Excellent support for creating dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs).
o HTML5/CSS3:
▪ Standard markup and styling languages for structuring content and defining styles.
▪ HTML5 for semantic structure, and CSS3 for layout, design, and responsiveness.
o Axios:
▪ A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.
▪ Useful for handling data fetching and API communication.
o Responsive Design Framework (e.g., Bootstrap):
▪ Ensures a consistent and responsive layout across various devices.
▪ Grid system and pre-styled components for rapid development.
• Back-End Technologies:
o Node.js:
▪ A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side scripting.
▪ Event-driven, non-blocking I/O for scalable and efficient server-side development.
o Express.js:
▪ A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
▪ Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs and handling of HTTP requests.
o Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):
▪ A relational database for storing structured data.
▪ SQL for defining and querying the database schema.
o Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) (e.g., Sequelize):
▪ Translates between objects in the code and tables in the database.
▪ Simplifies database interactions by using JavaScript objects.
• Technology Stack for Machine Learning:
o Python:
▪ Widely used for machine learning and data science.
▪ Offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for ML, such as scikit-learn, 
TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
o Jupyter Notebooks:
▪ Useful for prototyping and experimenting with machine learning models.
▪ Allows for interactive development and visualization.
o Scikit-learn:
▪ A powerful and user-friendly machine learning library for Python.
▪ Provides implementations of various algorithms for regression and classification 
tasks.
o TensorFlow or PyTorch:
▪ Deep learning frameworks that are suitable for more complex models, especially in 
the case of neural networks
