See basically the machine learning program is all about getting. The output data to suggest new llocations for the new charging stations entirely based on the data that was created while making requests from the app in the map page. Lets just say that there were 100 requests made from a certain area of the map and the closest station available to them, is very far away, now again there are 100 requests from another area…. Similarly all these data-s can be used to find a particular location where the new charging station can be placed… the model be trained and the final data shall be beneficial for data handling.
The data produced is not only going to be beneficial for us but also our competitors, including the government. Remember we just don’t want to set up charging stations or create an app for the purpose we just want top create a whole ecosystem, Nation wide.

--as of now we are yet to decide which model/algorith shall we use to train the model; for instance we are confused between linear regressor and random forest regressor.
--Furthermore we are trying to figure out how to feed the data to the model for training. We could only figure out that we have to create dummy data for it.
